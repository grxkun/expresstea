# expresstea [express.js for tea]
**Run Your Express Application** 
Start your Express application by running the following command in your terminal:
'node app.js'

**Access Your Application**
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see the message ‘Hello World!’.

This will set up a basic Express.js server that responds with ‘Hello World!’ when you access the root URL. You can expand on this by adding more routes, middleware, and functionality as needed for your project.
